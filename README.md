Gemini Clone 🚀


Welcome to the Gemini Clone project! This is a front-end web application that mimics a conversational AI interface, inspired by Google's Gemini. It's a great showcase of my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

🔥 Features
Responsive Design 🌐
The layout adapts beautifully to all screen sizes.
Dark and Light Mode 🌙☀️
Easily toggle between dark and light themes.
Chat Interface 💬
Simulates a chat experience with typing effects and message handling.
Local Storage 🗄️
Saves your chat history and theme preference even after you close the browser.
API Integration 🌐
Connects to an API to generate responses, demonstrating asynchronous JavaScript.

🛠️ How It Works

Clone the Repository:

git clone https://github.com/balagganesh/Gemini-Clone.git

cd Gemini-Clone

Open index.html in your favorite web browser.

See the interactive chat interface in action.

Toggle between dark and light modes using the button in the top-right corner.

Type messages or click on suggestions to see the chat interface respond.
